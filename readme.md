# Welcome Justice Reskill students!
# We want you all to know that you all belong here.
## Before beginning the program, you MUST do the following pre-course work 
## FreeCodeCamp
FreeCodeCamp is an online tool for learning web development. They have thousands of hours of problems to solve in ideas ranging from HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Algorithms and much more. Fortunately we only ask that you complete a small portion of that free coursework. 
Here is how to get started
- Head over to (Free Code Camp)[ https://freecodecamp.org ]. 
- Join Free code camp with either your google account, github account, facebook account, or email address
- Head to the Responsive Web Design course found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/
- Open up a problem in the "Basic HTML and HTML 5" course
- Then click on some problems (starting with "Say Hello to HTML Elements") and solve them
  - These are real practice problems
  - You are now an official programmer
- Your goal should be to FINISH the Basic HTML course work, and START the CSS coursework
## Shay Howe Book 
- This part is optional, but if you feel like you want to learn the concepts of html a little bit deeper head over to [Shayhowe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/)
- You will see a button saying "Start Learning HTML & CSS". Hit that button and start reading!
- Along with the reading there are exercises at the end of each chapter that you must follow along with.
